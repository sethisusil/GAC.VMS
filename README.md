## üéØ Project Objective

Design and implement a .NET-based integration system that connects **GAC‚Äôs Warehouse Management System (WMS)** with **external ERP systems**.
The system must support both **real-time API ingestion** and **file-based ingestion for legacy systems**.

## üîç Functional Requirements

### üì¶ Real-Time ERP Integration
- Expose RESTful APIs to receive:
  - Customer Master Data
  - Product Master Data
  - Purchase Orders (Inbound)
  - Sales Orders (Outbound)
- Validate incoming data and persist it in a relational database.

### üìÅ Legacy File-Based Integration
- Schedule polling of XML files from SFTP/shared folders.
- Parse and transform these files to WMS-compatible JSON payloads.
- Push transformed data to WMS REST APIs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements
- Platform: `.NET 9`
- Database: SQL Server
- Design Patterns: Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, Repository Pattern
- Retry logic for failure resiliency
- CRON-configurable background jobs
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker & Docker Compose support
- Markdown documentation with setup and architecture

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

---
### Run API Locally(Visual studio or Dotnet CLI)

#### Configuration Changes for Database Connection
- Move to GAC.WMS.Api and change the following section in `appsettings.json` file with correct sql server name in place of `.` and add user id and password if required 
```configuration
 "ConnectionStrings": {
   "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=GACWMS;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;"
 },
```
---
#### Configuration Changes for SFTP file path for legacy system[GAC.WMS.Worker]
- Create a folder in local directory with the path `C:\\GACWMS\\XmlFiles`
- Create a folder in local directory with the path `C:\\GACWMS\\XmlFiles`
- Copy these files `Customers.xml`, `Products.xml`,`PurchaseOrders.xml`,`SalesOrders.xml` from project root directory `./LegacySupportFiles` and place thme into `C:\\GACWMS\\XmlFiles`.
```configuration
"XmlFileConfig": {
  "BasePath": "C:\\GACWMS\\XmlFiles",
  "CustomerFileName": "Customers.xml",
  "ProductFileName": "Products.xml",
  "PurchaseOrderFileName": "PurchaseOrders.xml",
  "SalesOrderFileName": "SalesOrders.xml",
  "ProcessedPath": "C:\\GACWMS\\ProcessedFiles"
}
```
---
#### Configuration Changes for API communication for legacy system
- Move to GAC.WMS.Worker and open `appsettings.json`
- Replacse the base api base url fo `BaseUrl` in following section(Leavse as it is if your api runing in `https://localhost:7196/`)
```configuration
 "GACWMSApi": {
   "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:7196/",
   "UploadCustomerUrl": "api/Customer/upload",
   "UploadProductUrl": "api/Product/upload",
   "UploadPurchaseOrderUrl": "api/PurchaseOrder/upload",
   "UploadSalesOrderUrl": "api/SalesOrder/upload"
 }
```
---
#### Configuration Changes for cron scheduler
- Move to GAC.WMS.Worker and open `appsettings.json`
- Change following node value based on requirements(currenly it is withe very 5 minutes)
```configuration
"XmlPolling": {
  "Schedule": "*/5 * * * *" // every 5 mins
}
```
---

#### Run `GAC.WMS.Api` project through Visual Studio 2022
- Build project and run it using `F5` or `Visual Studio play button`
- Once it is up, you should be able see the following swagger page
    - You can test directly from swagger for all end points (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE)
    - Make sure not to pass id filed with value while creation

</p>



#### Run `GAC.WMS.Worker` project through Visual Studio 2022
- Right click on `GAC.WMS.Worker` and select `Debug` --> `Start New Instance`

---
#### Run projects through .Net CLI
- Open command prompt or powershell(Recomend to open in Admin mode)
```bash
cd GAC.WMS.Api
dotnet restore
dotn build
dotnet run
```
- Open a another new command prompt or powershell(Recomend to open in Admin mode)
```bash
cd GAC.WMS.Worker
dotnet run
```
---
### Run Tests
- Select `Test --> Run All Tests` from visual studio menu(You should be able to see bellow scree)
- This project contains total 226 test cases
[OR]
```bash
cd GAC.WMS.Api
dotnet test
```
<p align="center">
  <img width="248" alt="TestCases" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afe3c0ff-696e-4770-a003-9579eb2ab235" width="800" />
</p>


---
### Run with Docker Compose
- Make sure you docker desktop is up and runing
```bash
cd GAC.VMS
docker-compose up --build
```
- Make sure everything is good witout any error in console
- You check `http://localhost:5000/index.html` you should see the same swagger page.

---
### How to verify all good
- For API project make sure all GET,POST,PUT,DELETE end points are working witout any error
- For worker project
    - It will run in every 5 minutes
    - If all good al the files from `C:\GACWMS\XmlFiles` should be moved to `C:\GACWMS\C:\GACWMS\ProcessedFiles{ddmmyyyyhhmmss}` folder
    - Should able to see the data through API end points and sql server data verufucation

---

## üê≥ Docker Setup <a name="docker"></a>

- Defined for `GAC.WMS.Api/Dockerfile` for API 
- Defined for `GAC.WMS.Worker/Dockerfile` for Legacy worker 
- created `docker-compose.yml` to run API, Worker, and SQL Server
- `docker-compose.yml`e added under root directory

## ‚è±Ô∏è Background Worker <a name="background-worker"></a>

- Implemented using `IHostedService`
- CRON expression-based scheduling
- Polls directory or SFTP for XML files
- Transforms and sends data to WMS via REST

---

### `GACWMS` Databse
- Databse is created using `SQL Server`
- Datase is used using EF core code first approach
- Migration should be automatically applied to target DB on application load
